# Dynamic Prototyping
## Introduction
Dynamic Prototyping is a technique for editing .NET programs while they are running.

The idea is to allow the user to make immediate changes to the program that is currently running by editing and runtime-compiling the program's source code.
## Pre-condition
1. One class per file
2. Use DI container
## Guideline
1. Edit the source code
2. Use C# compiler to comppile just that class and get an in-memory implementation of the new type(System.Type). After that, use it to update some reference.
3. Update the registration options in the DI container.

## Example files
- Log.cs
- Payroll.cs
- ILog.cs
